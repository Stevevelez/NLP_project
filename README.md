# NLP Project: Sentiment analysis on Google Reviews

## Project Review

Often, when contemplating trying out a new restaurant or purchasing a new product, we turn to reviews to gauge the opinions of others on websites and Google. However, upon careful examination, we may discover that these opinions don't always align with the star ratings assigned to the respective site or item.

This realization sparked our interest in embarking on a project aimed at correlating the number of stars with sentiment analysis of the reviews. We chose to focus on Lambton College initially, but the methodology can be applied to any site or item featured in Google reviews.

## Chapters

Problem Definition: Not always a correlation between the reviews and the number of stars in Google reviews exists. 
Data Gathering: Webscrapping Google reviews.
Data Preparation: ____
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): By graphing our data we can find patterns, correlations, and unfair data. 
In the first stage, we did some plotting using Pyplot and Seaborn which allowed us to visualize our data and libraIn this step, I used heatmaps and correlation matrices to analyze the data.
Data Modelling: In this project, we used Selenium for Webscapping and VADER and TextBlob for the Sentiment analysis. Furthermore, we used Pandas for dataset management and Seaborn and Pyplot for plotting our data.

### Chapter 1: Problem definition

The prevalent issue in online reviews, particularly on platforms like Google, is the inconsistency between assigned star ratings and the sentiments conveyed in user reviews. When deciding on a new restaurant or product, users often find discrepancies between numerical ratings and the actual experiences described. This misalignment poses a significant challenge: the need for a more accurate correlation between quantitative ratings and qualitative sentiments. Our project, initially centered on Lambton College, aims to address this gap by developing a methodology applicable to any site or item on Google reviews. Our goal is to create a more reliable connection between star ratings and user sentiments, ultimately enhancing the reliability and usefulness of online reviews in decision-making processes.
